# MiniPuff

MiniPuff encourages you to post questions you believe a close friend and/or partner of yours should know the answers to. It then notifies you whenever someone out there got all the answers right, and lets you decide what your next action would be. It is an elegant yet intimate way to find you the person who is like-minded with you.

## Required User Story

As a MiniPuff user, I should be able to:

- [ ] Log in to the app with my Facebook account
- [ ] Post my own entry with a profile picture and 3 multi-select questions
- [ ] Browse a list of candidates with profile picture and location
- [ ] Tap on a candidate and be prompt with his/her question
- [ ] Answer candidates' questions with selection prompt
- [ ] Be notified whether I got all the answers correct or not
- [ ] Receive info from user who knows all the right answers to my questions
- [ ] Kindly send a personal message to whom got all my questions right

## Nice to Haves

As a MiniPuff developer, I should build an app that:

- [ ] Can prevent the user from using brute-force through the questions
- [ ] Sends push notification even the app is not running in foreground
- [ ] Allows editing/removal of the user's entry
- [ ] Has appealing UI color and flow
- [ ] Estimates likelihood and sorts the list of candidates accordingly
