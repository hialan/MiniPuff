# MiniPuff

MiniPuff encourages you to post questions you believe a close friend and/or partner of yours should know the answers to. It then notifies you whenever someone out there got all the answers right, and lets you decide what your next action would be. It is an elegant yet intimate way to find you the person who is like-minded with you.

## Required User Story

As a MiniPuff user, I should be able to:

- [ ] Log in to the app with my Facebook account
- [ ] Post 2-5 of my own multi-select questions
- [ ] Be provided with a question with answer options
- [ ] Be notified whether I got the answer right or wrong
- [ ] Be provided with next question
- [ ] Go into chat room with whom I got his/her 2 questions right
- [ ] Browse a list of previously chatted candidate

## Nice to Haves

As a MiniPuff developer, I should build an app that:

- [ ] Can prevent the user from using brute-force through the questions
- [ ] Sends push notification even the app is not running in foreground
- [ ] Allows editing/removal of the user's entry
- [ ] Has appealing UI color and flow
- [ ] Estimates likelihood and sorts the list of candidates accordingly
